 * Name: gd32_boardinitialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All GD32H7 architectures must provide the following interface to work
 *   with the board-specific logic:
 *
 *   void gd32_boardinitialize(void) - This function is called during
 *     system startup to perform board-specific initialization.  This is
 *     the place to do things like configure GPIO output pins to control
 *     LEDs, configure the SPI chip select GPIO pin, etc.
 *
 *     NOTE: Be very careful about what you do in this function.  Much of
 *     the system has not yet been initialized.
 *

 * Name: board_late_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_late_initialize().  board_late_initialize() will
 *   be called immediately after up_initialize() is called and just before
 *   the initial application is started.  This additional initialization
 *   phase may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device
 *   drivers.
